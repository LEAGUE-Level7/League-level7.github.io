                        Teachers can use the <a href="https://github.com/LEAGUE-Level7/Level7-React-Frontend-Template">Front End Template</a>
                    to demonstrate how we could use a React application to take search terms from users and display the results.  The following
                        steps will provide insight on how teachers can alter the template application to display results from
                        your application.

                        There are two completed projects running on AWS that demonstrate what the finished product looks like:

                    <p>
                       The way that this project and most major web applications are structured, is such that the backend and frontend are
                        discrete applications.  In order for our Spring application to accept requests from a different application, we need to enable CORS support.
                        This is the case whether we have production applications running on entirely different instances, or even just when we run these applications
                        locally but on different ports.  Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows applications to accept requests that
                        from a different domain.  These requests are typically blocked, for security reasons.  As an example that ignores some other security best-practices,
                        your computer might have a cookie saved in the browser that contains the login credentials for your bank account.  Someone could write some JavaScript
                        on any website that grabs your cookies, logs into your bank account, and transfers all of your money to them.  However, as previously mentioned,
                        this request would (hopefully) be blocked by the bank's CORS policy, as it is programmatic request from a domain that they don't own.  While they might have CORS
                        enabled, it would only apply to domains which they own.   While Spring allows us to specify domains for which we would like to enable CORS, you can simplify things
                        and just enable CORS in your controller classes by adding the following annotation above your Controller classes' class declaration.  If you wanted to
                        specify which domains you would like to enable CORS support for, it would be simply a matter of adding parentheses that contain a domain String after the
                        annotation.

                       To make this process as easy as possible, many of the fields that you need to change have been extracted into
                        the properties.js file.  You can easily set the course name, endpoint, description, Swagger URL, list of student
                        names, and repository URL within that file.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The only changes that require going further into the code are those required to make each SearchResult component
                        properly display the contents of each result from the request.  For example, the Cheetah Search application
                        retrieves a list of books, and displays a the title, authors, and link for each book.  The Jerboa Search
                        application retrieves a list of movies, and displays the title, overview, and release date for each movie.
                        The SearchResult component needs to be altered slightly to reflect the difference in data that is received.
                        <br/><br/>
                        If you are running your application locally, you can use a endpoint URL of http://localhost:5000/&ltwhatever your endpoint URL is&gt
                    </p>
                </div>

            <div class="module">
                <div class="titleBar">
                    <h3>Passing the Data to the SearchResult</h3>
                </div>

                    <p>
                        The SearchOutput component takes the list of data that we received from the request to the Spring application,
                        a creates a SearchResult component for each of the individuals pieces of data (each book, movie, etc).
                        On line 22 of SearchOutput.js, we need to create a prop for each of fields within our JSON object,
                        and set that equal to the field name within the JSON object.  Note that these correspond directly
                        to the list of fields that are contained with the Java object that the Spring application returns.
                    For Cheetah Search, the code on line 22 of SearchOutput.js look like this:
<pre>
 &ltSearchResult
         key={index}
         title={result.title}
         authors={result.authors}
         link={result.link}
 /&gt</pre>

                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="module">
                <div class="titleBar">
                    <h3>Displaying the Data Within the SearchResult</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="description">
                    <p>
                        Now all that is left is use the props that have been passed in the SearchResult component and
                    display them properly.  The starting on line 7 of SearchResult.js is essentially HTML, so if you are familiar with that, you can
                    play with the style of what is returned from the SearchResult to make it display exactly how you want.
                    The Cheetah Search example is actually more complicated than most, as it returns a list of authors that
                    are, in turn, mapped to an individual &ltp&gt tag:
                    <pre>
&ltarticle className={classes.Result}&gt
    &lth1&gtTitle: {props.title}&lt/h1&gt
    &lth3 className={classes.Author}&gt
    {props.authors && props.authors.map((author, index) =&gt (
        &ltp key={index}&gt{author}&lt/p&gt
    ))}
    &lt/h3&gt
    &lta href={props.link} rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt{props.link}&lt/a&gt
&lt/article&gt
</pre>
                    <br/><br/>
                    We can also see the final prop, link, is displayed as a clickable link that opens a new page.
                    <br/><br/>
                    If your object doesn't return any lists, you could simplify the above code greatly.  For example, the above code for
                    a made up animal object may look like this:
<pre>
&ltarticle className={classes.Result}&gt
    &lth1&gtSpecies: {props.species}&lt/h1&gt
    &lth3&gtNumber of legs: {props.numberOfLegs}&lth3&gt
&lt/article&gt
</pre>
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

                        From that point, you may need to run "yarn install" to install the project's dependencies.  After that,
                        "yarn start" will start the frontend application and automatically open it in your browser.

                        If you set up the front end correctly, you should now be able to enter a search query and display
                        results relevant to that term.  After our long journey, we have seen not only how to create
                        a production-quality Spring application that provides users with data based on a specific query, but
                        now how we could display that information to a user with modern React application.

                        If you have the frontend running, but when you submit a search nothing shows up, or it appears to load forever, there are only
                        a few things that could be going wrong.  To find the cause, open up the JavaScript (or developer) console in your browser and submit
                        your search again.  If you see a message being displayed that mentions CORS, revisit the first step of this section and update your
                        Spring application accordingly.  If that doesn't seem to be the issue, open the "network" tab of the developer console and submit your
                        search.  The request that is failing will likely show up in red.  Look at the status code for the request, and that will give you a good
                        hint as to where the problem is occurring.  If the status code is in the 400 range, that means there is an issue with the request you are
                        making from the frontend application.  Most likely, the URL and/or query parameters that you are attempting to submit are incorrect. If the
                        status code is in the 500 range, that means there is an issue with the Spring application when it tries to complete the request.  If
                        that is the case, you should see a stack trace being printed out by your Spring application that will give you a hint as to why it is
                        failing.  If the request to the Spring application is succeeding, and you receive a 200 status code, then the issue lies with how you are
                        handling the data once it is delivered to the frontend application.  Revisit the previous steps and confirm that you are properly displaying
                        the data on your page.
