<pre>
Your next mission is to write a program that reads in a base64 character string from a file. The program then converts the data represented in the string to a byte array of the appropriate length. Use the steps below to guide you along.

1. Read file into a string. (use the file base64_data.txt)
2. Calculate size needed for byte array.
3. Use the method you wrote in the previous part to fill the byte array with the correct data.
